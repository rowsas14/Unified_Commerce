# Data Import and AI Assisted Onboarding Module

## Purpose

Documents production scope for CSV/Excel import and AI-assisted onboarding while explicitly preserving the current schema gap for import and AI job persistence tables.

This module is part of the production-ready Unified Commerce E-POS + E-Commerce SaaS system. It must follow tenant isolation, role/permission validation, feature access validation, API rules, backend Clean Architecture rules, frontend implementation rules, audit requirements, and testing expectations defined in the 2nd Brain.

## Module scope

### In scope

- Maintain only the responsibilities explicitly described in this module and its feature specs.
- Use only database tables listed in this module or referenced by linked modules.
- Enforce tenant isolation for every tenant-owned operation.
- Apply backend authorization and feature access checks before changing data.
- Update audit logs or workflow history where the uploaded database design provides the required table.
- Keep frontend screens operational and workflow-focused, especially for POS-facing behavior.

### Out of scope

- Do not own responsibilities of unrelated modules.
- Do not create new tables that are not in the uploaded database design.
- Do not add CQRS, mediator, event sourcing, or undocumented architecture patterns.
- Do not bypass the API/backend/security rules documented in the 2nd Brain.


## Current schema gaps

- The uploaded database design does not define import job, import record, AI extraction, AI review, or duplicate candidate tables. Do not implement persistence for this module until schema is approved.

## Owned or primary tables

No approved database table is owned by this module in the uploaded database design. See the schema gap notes and do not invent persistence.


## Feature map

| Feature | Purpose | Primary tables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[07-modules/data-import-ai/features/csv-excel-import-scope/feature-spec|CSV and Excel Import Scope]] | Scope-defined import flow for product and customer onboarding with validation and manual review. | No approved table in current database |
| [[07-modules/data-import-ai/features/ai-assisted-extraction-scope/feature-spec|AI Assisted Extraction Scope]] | Scope-defined AI-assisted PDF/image/camera extraction behavior with confidence-based review. | No approved table in current database |
| [[07-modules/data-import-ai/features/duplicate-review-scope/feature-spec|Duplicate Review Scope]] | Scope-defined duplicate review behavior before saving imported product/customer data. | `products`, `product_variants`, `customers` |

## Dependency map

```text
Tenant context
  -> permissions and feature access
  -> module validation
  -> API request handling
  -> service layer workflow
  -> repository/data access
  -> audit/reporting where applicable
```

## Business rule summary

- Tenant-owned rows must never be shared across tenants.
- Status changes must follow documented status rules and allowed transitions where available.
- Monetary, stock, payment, refund, discount, receipt, offline sync, and audit-related changes must be validated by the backend.
- Frontend may guide the user and protect the workflow, but backend remains the final authority.
- Read-model/reporting tables are not source-of-truth transaction tables.
- Offline staging tables are not source-of-truth transaction tables.

## API reference policy

This module must follow [[04-api/endpoint-design|Endpoint Design]] and [[04-api/api-overview|API Overview]]. Do not invent endpoint names in implementation. Final API routes must be documented in the API folder before code is written.

## Backend implementation policy

- Use Clean Architecture with Service Pattern and Repository Pattern only.
- Controllers must remain thin.
- Application services orchestrate workflows.
- Domain entities/domain services hold pure business rules where applicable.
- Repositories handle data access.
- Unit of Work/transaction boundaries must protect multi-table writes.

## Frontend implementation policy

- Use React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- Use TanStack Query for server state.
- Use Zustand only for client workflow state.
- Never trust UI hiding as authorization.
- Keep POS-facing screens touchscreen-first, fast, and operational.

## QA checklist

- [ ] Tenant isolation tested.
- [ ] Permission and feature access tested.
- [ ] Required entities and FK relationships verified.
- [ ] API request/response validation tested.
- [ ] Backend service workflow tested.
- [ ] Frontend loading/error/empty states tested.
- [ ] Audit or history behavior tested where applicable.
- [ ] Offline behavior tested if the feature can operate offline.
- [ ] Reporting impact reviewed where applicable.

## Implementation notes for AI IDE tools

- Read this module README before editing any feature in this module.
- Read the target feature `feature-spec.md` and `feature-history.md` before coding.
- Do not implement schema gaps as new tables unless the database design is officially updated.
- Update feature history after implementation, bug fixes, or rule changes.
- Cross-reference related modules instead of duplicating rules.
