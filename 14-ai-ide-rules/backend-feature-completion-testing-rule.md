# Backend Feature Completion Testing Rule

## Purpose

This rule is **mandatory** for AI IDE tools and developers implementing backend features for the Unified Commerce E-POS + E-Commerce SaaS system.

When a backend feature’s implementation for the current task is **complete** (services, repositories, domain rules, API controllers — per task scope), the **same delivery must include** automated tests in **`POS.Tests`** for that feature. Do **not** stop after production code only and leave tests for “later,” unless the user **explicitly** asks for code-only delivery.

## Core references

| Area | Document / path |
|------|------------------|
| Test project layout & commands | Repository `Pos-BackEnd/POS.Tests/README.md` |
| Testing strategy | [[05-backend/testing-strategy]] (vault) or `Pos-BackEnd/docs/testing-strategy.md` (repo) |
| Backend folder structure | [[05-backend/backend-folder-structure]] |
| DTO rules | [[05-backend/dto-handling]] |
| Feature QA | `07-modules/.../features/.../feature-spec.md` checklist |

## When this rule applies

- After any backend change that adds or significantly changes: Application services, validators, Infrastructure repositories, Domain behavior, or API controllers **for a feature**.

## Required sequence (AI IDE)

1. Complete the feature code for the agreed scope.
2. **Immediately** add or update tests under `Pos-BackEnd/POS.Tests/` in the layer folder that matches the change:
   - **`Domain/`** — pure entity / value rules (no EF, no HTTP).
   - **`Application/`** — service orchestration (mock repositories; use **`FakeUnitOfWork`** from `Common/TestDoubles`).
   - **`Infrastructure/`** — repository + EF behavior (use **`TestDbContextFactory`** — SQLite in-memory).
   - **`Api/`** — HTTP contract (**`PosWebApplicationFactory`**).
3. **Mirror** the production module path (e.g. `Application/Modules/PlatformUsers/Services/PlatformAuthServiceTests.cs`).
4. Map the feature **`feature-spec.md` QA checklist** to concrete test methods using **`Method_Scenario_Expected`** naming.
5. Run **`dotnet test`** (full solution or filter by `FullyQualifiedName~POS.Tests.<Layer>`); fix failures before considering the task done.
6. Update **`feature-history.md`** for that feature when tests are added or materially changed.

## Minimum expectations by change type

| You changed… | You must add at least… |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Application service | Application tests: happy path + primary failure paths (validation, auth, tenant, status, not-found). |
| Repository method with non-trivial SQL/filters | Infrastructure test using `TestDbContextFactory` when tenant/filter correctness matters. |
| Public API endpoint | At least one API smoke test (`Api/`). |
| Non-trivial domain invariants | `Domain/` tests. |

Trivial edits (e.g. rename with no behavior change) may only update affected tests; do **not** skip tests when behavior changed.

## Naming

| Item | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Test class | `<SubjectUnderTest>Tests` |
| Test method | `Method_Scenario_Expected` (e.g. `LoginAsync_WhenPasswordWrong_ReturnsUnauthorized`) |

## Non-negotiable

- Tests live in **`POS.Tests`** only — not inside `POS.API`, `POS.Application`, etc.
- No real PostgreSQL or production secrets in automated tests; use shared helpers and SQLite for EF tests.
- Backend assertions must enforce tenant isolation, RBAC, and validation — not UI-only assumptions.
